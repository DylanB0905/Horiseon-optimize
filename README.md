# Horiseon-optimize
Search engine optimization Of Horiseon's Webpage

My motivation for this project was to optimize Horiseon's webpage in the search engine to the best of my ability.
The problem that I solved was that the html and css code for the webpage used alot of non- semantic elements so it wasn't very optimized for the browser.
I learned alot during this project. Mostly how to switch elements in html and css while still keeping the same look and functionality of the webpage.
